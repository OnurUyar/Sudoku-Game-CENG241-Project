# Sudoku Game (CENG241-Project)
The project we did with my teammates at the end of the 3rd semester for CENG 241 (Object Oriented Programming) course.    
  
In the project, together with my other 2 friends who took the same course, we used all the information, features and methods we learned in the object-oriented programming course throughout the semester.  
  
This project is an example of a puzzle game that is created by using console. This application contains nearly all features of the C++ language(normal functions, overloaded operators, constructors, class structures, etc.) that we learn in CENG241 course.    
  
It can be developed according to needs and can be setting an example for the users in the field.
